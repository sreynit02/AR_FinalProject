## Application: FollowerApp 
This application is to be used in conjunction with the leader application. This application is deployed on the HoloLens2 which is an Augmented Reality HMD. The application's main function is to allow the follower to talk with another device over the network, recognize targets, and record the time spent during the navigation task. We also utilized the HoloLens2 front camera to access real-time video recording of the follower's first-person point of view. 

## Instructions to load: 
1) Clone this repository and set the built-in player setting to UWP. Make sure you have Microsoft Visual Studio Code 2022 installed.
2) Connect the HoloLens2 to the computer using a USB cable. 
3) Click on the .sln file created from the build and open it with Microsoft Visual Studio Code 2022.
4) Now, in VS Code 2022, set the build type to "Release," the architecture to "ARM64," and the Device to "Device," which is the connected HoloLens2. 
5) It should take around 2-3 minutes to deploy to the HoloLens2. After the build is complete you can disconnect it from the computer.
6) On the HoloLens2, you can enter the application again by going to "all apps" and clicking on "A_FollowerApp".
