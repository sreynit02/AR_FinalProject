## Project Proposal: AR Car Fearture Guide
The proposed project aims to develop an Augmented Reality (AR) application that enhances the user experience by providing real-time information and instructional videos about different controls within a car. The application will leverage AR technology to detect various controls, offer descriptions of their functions, and present instructional videos or overlays on real objects demonstrating how to use each control effectively. The main objective is to develop an AR system capable of accurately detecting and recognizing different types of controls found in cars mainly focusing on the controls in front of the driver’s seat which are essential for drivers to know how to operate the car properly and be able to utilize those smart features fully. Some main steps to achieving this goal include mapping the interior of the car and capturing those main controls that I want to direct the user’s attention to. In addition, I need to implement a user-friendly interface with intuitive AR interactions and real-time guidance on how to use the specific feature. Currently, I plan to use Microsoft Hololen 2 to deploy this application. In terms of software, I will be utilizing Vuforia Engine SDK to help me with creating object targets and also mapping the inside of the car.
