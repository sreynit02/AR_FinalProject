## Project Proposal: AR Car Fearture Guide
The proposed project aims to develop an Augmented Reality (AR) application that enhances the user experience by providing real-time information and instructional videos about different controls within a car. The application will leverage AR technology to detect various controls, offer descriptions of their functions, and present instructional videos or overlays on real objects demonstrating how to use each control effectively. The main objective is to develop an AR system capable of accurately detecting and recognizing different types of controls found in cars mainly focusing on the controls in front of the driver’s seat which are essential for drivers to know how to operate the car properly and be able to utilize those smart features fully. 

Some main steps to achieving this goal include mapping the interior of the car and capturing those main controls that I want to direct the user’s attention to. This process requires some amount of precision to detail to ensure accurate detection and recognition of controls during AR interactions. Using tools provided by the Vuforia Engine SDK, I will create object targets for each control and integrate them into the AR application in Unity.

Once the controls are mapped and object targets are created, I will design and implement a user-friendly interface for the AR application. The interface will include intuitive AR interactions that allow users to look at the controls to trigger real-time information and instructional videos. I may decide to allow them to point to a specific control rather than using gaze to trigger the information. In addition, I also plan to incorporate real-time guidance features into the AR application. This involves developing functionalities that provide contextual guidance on how to manipulate specific controls to achieve a certain action. For example, when a user points the device at the steering wheel, the application may overlay instructions on how to engage cruise control or adjust vehicle settings.

Once the AR application is finished, I plan to deploy it on the Microsoft HoloLens 2. In terms of software, I will be utilizing Vuforia Engine SDK to help me with creating object targets and also mapping the inside of the car.
