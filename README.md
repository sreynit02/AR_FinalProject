## Application: FollowerApp 
This application is to be used in conjunction with the leader application. This application is deployed on the HoloLens2 which is an Augmented Reality HMD. The application's main function is to allow the follower to talk with another device over the network, recognize targets, and record the time spent during the navigation task. We also utilized the HoloLens2 front camera to access real-time video recording of the follower's first-person point of view.
