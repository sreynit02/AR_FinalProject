# AR_FinalProject
## Project Proposal

This project will apply Augmented Reality to assist with cooking in the kitchen. This application fits in the field of interaction because users will be able to interact with features in this application to help them accomplish their cooking tasks. The application can be used to recognize the needed ingredients and tell users the amount needed for a dish. This AR application can also display instructions overlaid onto the user's environment while they are cooking. In addition, it will be able to provide a timer to use.
